# A-B-Testing-for-Web-Banner
This test was conducted to investigate the influence of a web page banner that highlights key food and drink products on the conversion rate and the average amount spent by users (customers). A total of 48943 users participated in this test. The control group has 24343 while the treatment group contains 24600. The control group consists of the users who visited the existing web page that has no food and drink banner while the treatment page contains users who visited the new web page that has the food and drink banner. The test was conducted for 13 days. The outcome of the test reveals that a significant difference exists in the conversion rate but no significant difference exists between the average amounts spent by the two groups. However, due to the existence of novelty effect and inadequate sample size, it was recommended that the test should be repeated for more days to capture appropriate sample size.
